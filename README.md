This example shows how to run a Python script as cron job with GitHub Actions. It calls an API once a week (could be any schedule you want), logs the response in `status.log`, and automatically pushes the changes to this repo.

- Implement your script in `main.py`
- Inspect and configure cron job in GitHub Action `.github/workflows/actions.yml`
- It can install and use third party packages from `requirements.txt`
- Secret environment variables can be used. Set secrets in Settings/Secrets/Actions -> 'New repository secret'. Use the same secret name inside `actions.yml` and `main.py`
